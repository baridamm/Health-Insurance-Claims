Databases for Health Insurance Claims


The primary goal of this study was to design and implement a relational database that is industry ready for use in the health insurance industry for use by insurance and health care providers who have repeatedly complained about how the claim data input process that they are required to do is an extremely time-consuming process, and when looking at the problem as a whole, there is enormous amounts of data.
The creation of a relational database would assist insurance carriers in keeping track of all data in one location. It would assist to avoid data duplication and manual data entry, which would save a lot of time. The database was created with the claim process in mind. The EER and UML diagrams were modelled, and then the conceptual model was mapped to a relational model, with primary and foreign keys identified. This database was then developed in a MySQL environment, and a prototype with two tables and one relationship was created in a MongoDB database to better understand how this database would work in a NoSQL context.
The database was successfully created and subsequently connected to Python, allowing for the comparison of numerous details, some of which are given in the following sections.
